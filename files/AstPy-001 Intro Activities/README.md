# Intro Activities

These introductory notebooks are designed to give you basic Python skills and let you practice them. Python is used by Astronomers all over the world to run simulations, analyse telescope data, and much much more. The first activity teaches you the basics of Python 3, and NumPy - a Python library for numerical calculations and arrays. The fourth tackles Matplotlib - a plotting library, and Pandas - a library for manipulating csv's and other files. The rest of the intro activities get you to practice using the skills you have learnt and build on them further.

If you are stuck you can consult the Python and NumPy docs at https://docs.python.org/3/, and https://numpy.org/doc/stable/, find help from one of these websites www.w3schools.com, www.python.org, www.learnpython.org (great intro lessons here) or you can also get advice from www.stackoverflow.com.

The Numpy section was adapted from work by Ridwan Barbhuiyan - https://github.com/rbarbhuiyan.      
Inspiration was taken from the Exoplanet Transit Lab from the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, Canada here: https://centreoftheuniverse.org/transit-lab, and the work of Adam LaMee's Coding in K12 here: https://adamlamee.github.io/.

Thanks to Mary MacDonald, Planetarium Manager at the Christa McAuliffe [Center for Integrated Science Learning](https://cm-center.org/) for testing activities 1-4 and providing feedback.
