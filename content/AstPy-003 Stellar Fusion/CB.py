## Coloumb Barrier

# Nucleons attract each other via the strong force.
# Charged particles repel each other with the Coulomb force.

# Since the first stage of fusion in a star is two protons colliding they need to overcome their repulsion.
# More precisely they need to overcome the Coulomb Barrier by having a certain energy.

# The potential barrier is approximated by the electric potential energy:
# Vc(r) = 14.3996 (unit eV Angstrom e^(-2)) *Z1Z2e^2/r 
# at distance greater than
# rn approx equal 1.44*10**(-13)(A1^1/3 + A2^1/3) cm
# Using units of eV and Angstrom we get Vc(r) in eV.
# The top of the barrier is:
# Vb approx = Vc(rn) = Z1*Z2 / (A1^1/3 + A2^1/3) MeV
# At distances closer than rn the nuclei fuse and drop into the "nuclear well".

# We can visualise the barrier for two protons like this:

rn = 1.44*(1**(1/3)+1**(1/3)) # fm

# array of distance values, find the index where r=rn
r = np.arange(0,10.01,0.01)
indrn = np.where(r==rn)[0][0]
# initialise the Vc(r) array
Vc = np.zeros(len(r))
# for r greater than rn calculate the electric potential energy
for i in range(indrn+1,len(r)):
    # here we convert r to Angstrom and then divide by a million to get MeV
    Vc[i] = 14.3996 / (r[i]/100000) / 1000000 # MeV
# set the barrier potential energy at rn
Vb = 1/(1**(1/3)+1**(1/3))
Vc[indrn] = Vb # MeV
# set the nuclear well potential energy to the binding energy of the product (in this case deuterium)
bEDeuterium = -1112.283/1000 # MeV
for i in range(0,indrn):
    # this value was taken from the mass16.csv
    Vc[i] = bEDeuterium

# In reality quantum tunneling allows the nuclei to 'tunnel' through the peak of the barrier.
# This means they need a lower Energy to fuse.
# Since energy is related to temperature a lower required energy means the required temperature is also lower.
# If it weren't for quantum tunneling the probability of fusion in our sun would be very small.
