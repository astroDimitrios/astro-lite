    "We are going to look at some data on the eight planets and some moons using the Pandas library. Pandas is a data analysis library that has more useful features than the standard Python csv library. It has built in data analysis tools which are very fast, they are more memory efficient, and the Pandas dataframe (where we store our data) has built in search functions. There are loads of reasons why programmers love Pandas, you can find the Pandas documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go ahead and use Pandas to load the data you can have a look inside the file that we will be using. On the left of the Jupyter Lab interface you should see the file tree. The file with the orange icon is the interactive notebook you are working on right now. The csv (comma separated value) file with our data in has a green window icon and is called **planets.csv**. Double click on **planets.csv** and it will open as a new tab in Jupyter Lab interface. Have a look at the data included in the file then come back here to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's load the data using Python. First we have to import Pandas. If we import it ```as pd``` then we can just type ```pd``` instead of ```pandas``` when we want to use the library:"
