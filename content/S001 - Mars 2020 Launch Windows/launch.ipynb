    "To get a rover to Mars you first have to fire your rocket so that it escapes the Earth's gravitational pull. The rover then coasts in its housing to Mars and fires thrusters to slow down and land on the Martian surface at the end of its journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most energy efficient way of getting our rover to Mars is with a Hohmann transfer.\n",
    "A Hohmann transfer between the Earth and Mars is shown in the image below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that there is also a dashed grey line in this image. The two grey lines together form the Hohmann orbit. So a Hohmann transfer is one half of a Hohmann orbit!\n",
    "\n",
    "For our transfer to work the spacecraft must leave Earth at the Hohmann orbit's perihelion (the point on the orbit when you're closest to the Sun) and arrive at Mars at the Hohmann orbit's aphelion (the point on the orbit when you're furthest from the Sun).\n",

    "* Earth and Mars travel at constant speeds (they don't - remember Kepler's 3rd law!)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Heliocentric Longitude** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"LONG\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using heliocentric longitudes when talking about the positions of Earth and Mars. A heliocentric longitude is the position of an object with repsect to the Sun (hence helio - Sun, centric - centre). It is measured from the primary direction, which is the position of the Earth at the vernal equinox, around the ecliptic plane counterclockwise. The ecliptic plane is an imaginary disk swept out by a line connecting the Earth and the Sun as the Earth completes one orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means at launch the Earth is at a longitude of $0^{\\circ}$ and at landing Mars is at $180^{\\circ}$. This is shown in the image below which looks down on the ecliptic plane.\n",
